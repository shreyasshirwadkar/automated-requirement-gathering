## ❗ Current Issues

- **Manual Requirement Gathering**: Time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Unstructured Data**: PDFs, chats, voice inputs slow down processing.
- **Incomplete Specifications**: Missing details delay projects.
- **Compliance Risks**: Manual checks miss PCI DSS, GDPR standards.
- **Manual Effort**: Artifact creation (user stories, docs) is time-intensive.

---

## 🎯 Solution Goal

Leverage **Generative AI** to automate:
- Extraction
- Generation
- Formatting
- Validation
- Documentation
- JIRA Integration

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

### 1. Requirements Collection & Preprocessing

- **Input**: User provides data via PDF, Word, voice, or unstructured chats, along with target user details.
- **Processing**:
  - AI converts unstructured data into structured format.
  - Filters out irrelevant details.
  - Extracts key requirements via an intuitive onboarding experience.

---

### 2. Requirement Analysis & Refinement

- **AI Actions**:
  - Fills missing requirement details using context and industry standards.
  - Asks follow-up questions for clarity (Feedback loop).
  - Ensures regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, banking regulations).
- **Iteration**:
  - Refines requirements through user feedback until confirmed complete.

---

### 3. Artifact Generation

- **Deliverables**:
  - Finalized requirement document.
  - Excel sheet with JIRA user stories and detailed requirements.

- **Outcome**:
  - Ready-to-use artifacts for development and testing.
  - Dashboard to display user stories and requirements for monitoring.

---

### 4. 🔧 Additional Features

- **JIRA Integration**: Automates backlog population.
- **Automated Testing**: Generates test cases.
- **Code Generation**: Produces boilerplate code.
- **Visualization**: Generates architecture/system design diagrams.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to requirements and artifacts, enabling traceability and rollback.
